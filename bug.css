The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, there can be issues if the calculation results in a value that is not valid for the particular property being applied.  For example, attempting to set a negative width or height will likely result in unexpected behavior or the property being ignored.  Another error can occur if there are typos or incorrect operator usage within the `calc()` expression. These lead to unexpected results or the CSS failing to parse.
